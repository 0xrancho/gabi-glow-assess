BUILD ON THIS CONTEXT - don't repeat what we know, find what we don't.
` : '';

  return `
Research ${company} specifically and their market context for AI transformation.

${contextSection}

STEP 1: RESEARCH THE ACTUAL COMPANY
Search for "${company}" ${emailDomain ? `OR site:${emailDomain}` : ''}:
- Find their website, About page, team page, services page, case studies
- Look for: How many employees, years in business, key differentiators
- Extract their positioning: What do they promise clients?
- Find LinkedIn company page for team size and employee backgrounds
- Look for reviews on Clutch, G2, or industry sites
- Identify their actual clients if mentioned anywhere
- What certifications, partnerships, or specializations do they advertise?

STEP 2: ANALYZE THEIR CURRENT STATE VS DIGITAL PRESENCE
Based on ${company}'s website and online presence:
- What tools/certifications do they advertise having?
- What does their sales process look like from their site?
- How do they position themselves vs competitors in ${location}?
- What are their strengths based on their marketing materials?
- What are they NOT talking about (potential gaps)?

Their stated internal process: "${teamProcess}"
Their team appears to include: ${teamMembers.join(', ')}
Compare this to what their website promises clients - where's the disconnect?

STEP 3: RESEARCH SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR SPECIFIC SITUATION
Now that you understand ${company}, find targeted solutions:

TOOLS & PLATFORMS:
- AI solutions that work with ${solutionStack}
- Focus on ${revenueChallenge} for ${businessType} companies
- Must handle teams with ${teamMembers.length} people in the process
- Budget reality: ${investmentLevel} for a ${businessType} company
- Include actual pricing, integration complexity, setup time
- Prioritize tools that solve "${extractKeyBottleneck(teamProcess)}"

PEER COMPANIES:
- Find similar ${businessType} companies (similar size to ${company})
- Located in or serving ${location} market if possible
- Who has successfully automated ${revenueChallenge}
- Include specific metrics, timelines, and investment amounts
- Look for case studies with before/after process descriptions

MARKET CONTEXT:
- How are ${company}'s competitors in ${location} handling ${revenueChallenge}?
- What's happening in ${businessType} market specifically for ${opportunityFocus}?
- Industry trends affecting companies like ${company}
- What are the adoption rates and success factors?

STEP 4: CALCULATE THEIR SPECIFIC OPPORTUNITY
Based on ${company}'s actual situation:
- Their stated challenge: "${additionalContext}"
- If they're at 3% conversion and industry average is X%, calculate the revenue gap
- With their business model, what's the real financial impact?
- Consider their team cost (${teamMembers.length} people: ${teamMembers.join(', ')})
- Factor in ${location} market dynamics and competition

STEP 5: FIND UNEXPECTED INSIGHTS
- What adjacent solutions could specifically help ${company}?
- What are companies in OTHER industries doing for similar challenges?
- Based on their team composition, what would they find surprising but valuable?
- What non-obvious competitive advantages could AI give them?
- What would make ${company} stand out in ${businessType} in ${location}?

RETURN SPECIFIC INFORMATION about ${company}, not generic ${businessType} advice.
Include URLs, citations, actual numbers, real company examples, specific tool names.

Focus on making this feel like: "We researched ${company} specifically and here's what we found..."
Not: "Here's generic advice for ${businessType} companies..."

BUILD ON THIS CONTEXT - focus on the gaps, don't repeat what we know.
` : '';

  return `
Research ${company} specifically and fill intelligence gaps for AI transformation.

${ragContextSection}

STEP 1: RESEARCH THE ACTUAL COMPANY
Search for "${company}" ${emailDomain ? `OR site:${emailDomain}` : ''}:
- Company profile: team size, years in business, market position
- Website analysis: what they promise vs their internal process
- LinkedIn company page and employee backgrounds
- Client testimonials, case studies, reviews on G2/Clutch
- Competitive positioning in ${location} ${businessType} market

STEP 2: GABI FRAMEWORK CATEGORIZATION
For ALL solutions found, categorize by GABI layers:

**Context Orchestration Layer**: Business logic, decision engines, role-based workflows
- Tools that understand business rules and user roles
- Examples: CRM workflows, approval systems, intelligent routing

**Knowledge Retrieval Layer**: Information access, search, data enrichment
- Tools that find, organize, or enhance information
- Examples: Lead databases, research tools, vector databases

**Function Execution Layer**: Automation, integrations, deterministic operations  
- Tools that perform actions and connect systems
- Examples: Zapier, Make.com, API orchestrators

**Conversational Interface Layer**: Natural language interaction, chatbots, voice
- Tools that enable human-like communication
- Examples: ChatGPT integrations, voice assistants, chatbots

For each tool, specify: "This addresses the [LAYER NAME] by [specific function for ${company}]"

STEP 3: ENHANCED GITHUB/IMPLEMENTATION SEARCH
Search GitHub specifically:
- Query: site:github.com "${businessType}" AND "${revenueChallenge}" stars:>50
- Filter: updated:>2024-01-01, language:python OR typescript OR javascript
- Extract: README implementation details, documented results, tech stack
- Look for: ${teamMembers.length}-person team implementations

Search for implementation blogs/case studies:
- "${businessType}" + "automated ${revenueChallenge}" + "results"
- Companies with similar stack: ${solutionStack}
- Focus on 2023-2024 implementations only

STEP 4: COMPETITIVE MARKET POSITIONING  
Position ${company} in their market:
1. Find 3-5 direct competitors in ${location}
2. Compare their processes vs ${company}'s: "${teamProcess}"
3. Compare their tech stacks vs ${company}'s: "${solutionStack}"
4. Identify ${company}'s unique advantages and gaps
5. Show how AI could give ${company} competitive differentiation

STEP 5: SPECIFIC OPPORTUNITY CALCULATION
Based on ${company}'s actual situation:
- Current challenge: "${additionalContext}"
- Current process involves: ${teamMembers.join(', ')}
- With ${teamMembers.length} people handling ${revenueChallenge}
- Calculate time savings, cost reduction, revenue impact
- Factor in ${location} market dynamics and wage costs

STEP 6: UNEXPECTED INSIGHTS & ADJACENCIES
- What adjacent industries have solved similar problems?
- What would be surprising but valuable for ${company} to know?
- Non-obvious competitive advantages AI could provide
- Emerging solutions not in our curated database
- What would make ${company} a market leader in ${businessType} AI adoption?

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. ALWAYS specify GABI layer for each solution
2. Include actual URLs, GitHub repos, citations  
3. Focus on 2024-2025 data only
4. Make this about ${company} specifically, not generic advice
5. Fill the identified research gaps
6. Show competitive positioning analysis
7. Include implementation complexity and timelines
8. Provide specific ROI calculations for ${company}

Focus on making this feel like: "We researched ${company} extensively and here's what we found that you don't know..."
